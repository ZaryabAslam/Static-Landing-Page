# Kaira â€” Bootstrap-only Homepage

This is a **pure HTML + CSS + Bootstrap** project:

## How to use (as requested: Bootstrap via npm)

1. Open a terminal in this folder and install packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start a tiny static server (no frameworks, just to serve local `node_modules`):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

   > You can also open `index.html` directly in the browser. But serving via a local server is recommended so the `node_modules` paths work consistently.

## Notes

- No custom JavaScript was written. The only runtime JS is Bootstrap's own bundle for the carousel.
- Icons come from **bootstrap-icons** (also installed via npm).
- Small CSS-only animations are included for hover/lift and caption fade-in.
